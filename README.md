# Stock-Prediction-Analysis-Using-LSTM-Model
Forecast Uber stock prices using an LSTM model, leveraging historical data for accurate predictions. Embrace AI's potential in financial analysis and make informed decisions.

# Description
This GitHub repository hosts an advanced financial analysis project centered around predicting Uber's stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Leveraging historical stock data, this project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in the realm of finance. LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies makes it a potent tool for predicting stock trends.

# LSTM Model
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to effectively capture and learn from sequential data. It excels at understanding long-range dependencies and patterns within sequences, making it ideal for tasks like time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
